# Client

This script is for deployment on P4wnP1_ALOA. It embeds the C++ version client of 360 team. I just add `exit()` when receive `TUNNEL_SHELL_ACP`. Use `client.ps1` to replace `wifi_agent.ps1`, or modify the `wifi_covert_channel.sh`.

The go version Client seems a huge work, cuz we need to call windows native wireless api. Maybe I can finish it this week.
